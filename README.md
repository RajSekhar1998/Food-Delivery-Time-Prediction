# Food-Delivery-Time-Prediction
This project focuses on predicting the delivery time for food orders using machine learning techniques. By analyzing historical delivery data, we aim to build a model that can accurately estimate how long it will take for food to reach customers, improving operational efficiency and customer satisfaction.
ðŸš€ Project Overview
  Goal: Predict delivery times based on order and traffic conditions.
  Dataset: Contains ~45,000 rows with features like order date, time, traffic density, weather,       vehicle type, and delivery duration.
  Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn.

ðŸ§ª Features & Workflow
1. Data Loading & Cleaning
    Handled missing values and inconsistent data formats.
    Parsed time-related fields for better feature extraction.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
    Visualized distributions and correlations using seaborn and matplotlib.
    Identified key drivers for delivery time such as traffic conditions and vehicle types.

3. Feature Engineering
    Created new time-based features.
    Converted categorical variables using encoding techniques.

4. Model Building
    Applied multiple regression models.
    Evaluated performance using metrics like MAE, MSE, and RÂ².

5. Optimization
    Fine-tuned models using hyperparameter tuning (e.g., GridSearchCV).

ðŸ“ˆ Results
The best-performing model achieved a reasonable prediction accuracy, making it suitable for integration into logistics or delivery management systems.
